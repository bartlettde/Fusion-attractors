# Fusion-attractors
This add-in allows users to visualise strange attractors in their Autodesk Fusion 360 environments.

## Why? 
Honestly... there is no good reason why. This tool is not useful in anyway. But I found it interesting to create the tool, learn about strange attractors and the Fusion 360 API.

## Supported Attractors
The tool can visualise the following attractors:
- Lorenz
- Thomas
- Aizawa
- Dadras
- Chen
- Lorenz84
- RÃ¶ssler
- Halvorsen
- Rabinovich-Fabrikant
- Sprott
- Four-wing

## Getting Started
To get this add-in running, follow the steps below:
- Clone the repo
- In Fusion 360, in the design workspace, click on the Tools tab
- Select the Scripts and Add-ins button
- In the window that should have appeared, click on the Add-ins tab
- Select the little green plus next to the title that reads My Add-ins
- In the file explorer window, locate the repo and select the folder
- Find the strange attractors add-in in the list, select it and press run
- A new icon should have been added in the tool bar in the Add-in group
